# cpp-vkbot
A simple, yet slow bot for VK social network

### Dependencies
	libcurl

## What can it do?
As of now, pretty much nothing. Except for shitposting

You can find all the commands in __*src/commands.cpp*__ and __*include/commands.hpp*__ or add your own ones, if you are smart enough to understand my spaghetti code :)

## Using
First of all, you should paste your token and group ID into the file __*include/api.hpp*__ (sooner it'll change). Then just run:
	
	make
And that's all for now.


TODO:
- [X] tolower() implementation
- [ ] performance optimization
- [ ] decent interfaces for better commands
- [ ] config loader
