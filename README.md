# cpp-vkbot
A simple, yet slow bot for VK social network

### Dependencies
	libcurl

## What can it do?
As of now, pretty much nothing. Except for shitposting

You can find all the commands in __*src/commands.cpp*__ and __*include/commands.hpp*__ or add your own ones, if you are smart enough to understand my spaghetti code :)

## Bulding
	make
That's all for now.

TODO:
~~- [X] tolower() implementation~~
- [ ] performance optimization
- [ ] decent interfaces for better commands
